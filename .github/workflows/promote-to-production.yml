# Promotion Workflow
#
# This workflow is manually triggered to promote tested changes from 'main' to 'release'.
# It performs a merge from main branch to release branch, which then triggers
# the production deployment workflow.
#
# Role in release workflow:
# - Manually triggered via GitHub Actions UI
# - Merges tested changes from 'main' → 'release' branch
# - Triggers production deployment automatically after merge
# - Acts as the final approval gate before production release
